                means that failover of a StatefulSet pod is a manual operation. \n
                By enabling Pod Fencing and setting the `storageos.com/fenced=true`
                label on a Pod, StorageOS will enable automated Pod failover (by killing
                the application Pod on the failed node) if the following conditions
                exist: \n - Pod fencing has not been explicitly disabled. - StorageOS
                has determined that the node the Pod is running on is   offline.  StorageOS
                uses Gossip and TCP checks and will retry for 30   seconds.  At this
                point all volumes on the failed node are marked   offline (irrespective
                of whether fencing is enabled) and volume   failover starts. - The
                Pod has the label `storageos.com/fenced=true` set. - The Pod has at
                least one StorageOS volume attached. - Each StorageOS volume has at
                least 1 healthy replica. \n When Pod Fencing is disabled, StorageOS
                will not perform any interaction with Kubernetes when it detects that
                a node has gone offline. Additionally, the Kubernetes permissions
                required for Fencing will not be added to the StorageOS role."

                the network, which could take a while.   - Running: The NFS Server
                has been bound to a node, and all of the     dependencies have been
                created.   - Succeeded: All NFS Server dependencies have terminated
                in success,     and will not be restarted.   - Failed: All NFS Server
                dependencies in the pod have terminated, and     at least one container
                has terminated in failure. The container     either exited with non-zero
                status or was terminated by the system.   - Unknown: For some reason
                the state of the NFS Server could not be     obtained, typically due
                to an error in communicating with the host of     the pod."
